Our students won the 1st prize at the SEACAS 2019 Hackathon with the "Magic Spoon" project, a prototype designed to stabilize hand tremors commonly experienced by Parkinson's patients. Unlike conventional PID control, this project utilized a single-layer perceptron to control a servo motor, and included a database and Android application for diagnosis and treatment suggestions.

Our team also participated in the IEEE CASS Student Design Competition, held as part of [ISCAS 2020](https://ieee-cas.org/event/cass-student-design-competition-2020-covid-19-special) in Seville, Spain, with both in-person and online attendance due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
